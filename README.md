### GEC Literature Review:

[Grammatical error correction using neural machine translation, NAACL 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1042.pdf):

* The authors presented the first study using neural machine translation (NMT) for grammatical error correction (GEC). The used unsupervised alignments (METEOR) to deal with OOV words as a post-processing step.

[Neural Language Correction with Character-Based Attention, 2016](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09727.pdf):

* NOTE: This is the first paper of GEC as a char-level encoder decoder model.
* The authors use a char-level encoder decoder model with attention for GEC.
