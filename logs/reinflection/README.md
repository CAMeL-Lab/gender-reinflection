# Reinflection Results:

This directory has all the logs and reinflcetion results for all the experiment we report in the paper. </br></br>
`do_nothing/`: the do nothing baseline refinlection results on the dev and test sets.</br>
`mle/`: the bigram MLE baseline refinlection results on the dev and test sets.</br>
`joint_models/`: the joint models reinflection results on the dev set. We also include the results of the best model on the test set.</br>
`disjoint_models/arin.to.[F|M]`: the reinflection results for the masculine and feminine disjoint models on the dev set. It also has the concatenation of both reinflections results `disjoint_models/dev.arin.to.M+F.disjoint+morph.inf.norm` on the dev set. This is needed for gender identification evaluation.
